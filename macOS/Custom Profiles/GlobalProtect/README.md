# GlobalProtect System Extension
On the GlobalProtect app 6.0.4 and later and 6.1 releases running on macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and later or macOS Big Sur 11, you can use Microsoft Intune to configure a GlobalProtect configuration profile to automatically load system extensions that are required for the split tunnel, enforce GlobalProtect connections for network access, and split DNS features.

This Custom Profile is created so you can automatically load system extensions.
