# This section of scripts is for Miscellaneous stuff

The scripts in this section are mostly related to general macOS configuration via the [Intune Shell Scripting Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts). Where possible we recommend using Intune native configuration, or custom profile to control the behaviour of macOS. However, in certain cases we need to deploy a shell script to do what we need.

- Configure Company Portal usage data preferences
- Setting timezone
- Download custom desktop wallpaper
- Configure the Dock in a certain way
- Run a scheduled MDATP scan job
