# Example Custom Profiles

Where Intune does not yet have a specific macOS payload aavailable within the UI, we can create a custom profile and deploy that via Intune instead. In most cases these profiles are created via [Apple Configurator 2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12) or from [Apple Server Configuration Manager](https://apps.apple.com/app/macos-server/id883878097?mt=12).

Unless specified, the files in this section are all mobileconfig files and should be delivered to the Mac via an Intune Custom Profile. For more information see the following: [Use custom settings for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/custom-settings-macos)
